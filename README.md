## Key Features
- Decorator Functions: The module provides a set of convenient decorators such as @CacheWrap, @CacheDel, @CacheSet, and @CacheGet that seamlessly integrate with your NestJS project. These decorators allow you to easily wrap methods, delete cached values, set new values, and retrieve cached data, all with minimal effort.

- **Reduced Boilerplate**: With NestJS Cache Module, you can significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code required for caching operations. The decorators handle the caching logic for you, so you can focus on building the core functionality of your application without getting bogged down in caching implementation details.

- **Simple Setup Process**: Integrating NestJS Cache Module into your NestJS project is a breeze. The module provides clear and straightforward installation instructions, making it easy for you to get up and running quickly.

- **Flexible Cache Management**: Leveraging the power of the underlying Node.js cache manager library, NestJS Cache Module offers a wide range of cache management options. You can choose from various caching strategies, including in-memory caching, Redis caching, and more, depending on your specific requirements.

- **Highly Customizable**: The module allows you to customize caching configurations according to your needs. You can fine-tune cache expiration times, cache keys, cache prefixes, and other settings to ensure optimal performance and tailored caching behavior for your application.
